Unmatched Routes

Navigation from the UI

In the case of Navigation within the UI, Nextjs retains the previsouly active state of a slot
regardless of changes in the URL.

Page reload

Next.js immediately searches for a default.tsx file within each unmatched slot.

The presense of this file is critical, as it provides the default content that Next.js will render 
in the user interface.

If this default.tsx file is missing in any of the unmatched slots for the current route, 
Next.js will render a 404 error


default.tsx file

The default.tsx file in Next.js serves as a fallback to render content when the framework cannot retrive 
a slots active state from the current URL

You have complete freedom to define the UI for unmatched routes: you can either mirror the content found in page.tsx
or craft an entirely custom view
