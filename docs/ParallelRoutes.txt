Parallel routes are advance routing mechanisms that allows for the simultaneous routing 
of multiple pages within the same layout

Paralles routes in Next.js are defined using a feature known as slots

Slot helps structure our content in a modular fashion

To define a slot, we use the @folder naming conventions

Each slot is then passed as a prop to its corresponding "layout.tsx" file
