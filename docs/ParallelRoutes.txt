Parallel routes are advance routing mechanisms that allows for the simultaneous routing 
of multiple pages within the same layout

Paralles routes in Next.js are defined using a feature known as slots

Slot helps structure our content in a modular fashion

To define a slot, we use the @folder naming conventions

Each slot is then passed as a prop to its corresponding "layout.tsx" file

Parallel Routes Benefits :-

A clear benefit of parallel routes is their ability to split a layout into various slots,
making the code more manageable

Independent route handling

Each slot of your layout, such as user analytics or revenue metrics, can have its own loading and error states 

This granular control is particularly beneficial in scenarios where different secitons of the page load at varying 
speeds or encounter unique errors.

Sub navigaiton

Each slot of your dashboard can essentially functions as a mini-application, complete with its own navigation and state management

This is especially useful in a complex application such as our dashboard where different sections serve distinct purposes
