Routing Metadata

Ensuring proper SEO is crucial for increasing visibility and attracting users

Next.js introduced the Metadata API which allows you to define metadata for each page

Metadata ensures accurate and relevant information is displayed when your pages are shared or indexed


Configuring Metadata

With the new app router there are two ways to methods to configure metadata

1. Export a static metadata object
2. Export a dynamic generateMetadata function

Metadata rules

Both layout.tsx and page.tsx files can export metadata. If defined in a layout, it applies to all pages in that layout,
but if defined in a page it applies only to that page.
